                          <p class="p-desc"> We advertise 'Native speaker instructor 20 times a month 10,000 won'. Even if it is inexpensive, it is too lethal and cheap. The point is that the instructor will earn enough money because the instructor will pay most of the tuition, which is 75%. If you are a Filipino instructor, you can earn 15,000 pesos (about 300,000 won) a month. If you work eight hours a day, you can have 40 minutes of ten-minute classes (including 10 minutes break every hour). <span  id="tuition"class="text-primary pointer">Read More....</span></p>
                          <p id="child-tuition" class="p-desc"> In addition to satisfying students with very low tuition fees, we are also able to satisfy our instructors with very high payouts. Generally speaking (even in the Philippines) an English instructor can hardly take his or her salary at a fixed salary or similar level, but his instructor takes that five times. Something front and back is not right? It will not make any sense if the student does not pay the fee directly and the student will only pay 10,000 won a month, but it will be difficult to understand how the instructor can bring the high allowance. </p>

In particular, Weissner is the only company in the world that has recruited lecturers from home tutors and schools from around the world and has a direct system ecosystem. The instructor will set the tuition fee as he / she likes, the student can charge the tuition fee as much as the credit card, and the student can reserve, cancel or change freely. 100% automated management LMS system that does not require.
